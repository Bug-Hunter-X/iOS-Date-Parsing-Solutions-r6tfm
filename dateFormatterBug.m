In Objective-C, a subtle error can occur when dealing with `NSDateFormatter`. If you don't set the `dateFormat` property correctly, or if the format string doesn't match the date string you are trying to parse, the date formatter might return `nil` unexpectedly, leading to crashes or incorrect behavior further down the line.  This can be especially problematic when handling user input or data from external sources where the date format might be inconsistent or unexpected.
