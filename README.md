# Objective-C NSDateFormatter Bug: Unexpected nil Return

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug involving `NSDateFormatter` in Objective-C.  The bug arises from the unexpected return of `nil` when attempting to parse dates due to incorrect date format strings.  This can lead to crashes or data inconsistencies if not properly handled.

## Bug Description
The core issue lies in inconsistent or improperly configured date format strings supplied to the `NSDateFormatter`.  If the format string does not accurately reflect the structure of the date string being parsed, `NSDateFormatter` may fail silently, returning `nil`.  This `nil` value can then propagate through your application, potentially leading to crashes or erroneous data processing.

## Solution
The solution involves rigorous input validation and robust error handling. Always check the return value of `dateFromString:` to ensure it's not `nil` before proceeding with date manipulation.  Additionally, carefully verify the date format string against the date string being parsed.
